I don't have the full content of the `src/components/ui/fluid-cursor.tsx` file in the provided code snippets, so I can't provide the complete code with the COLORFUL property added. The AI only provided a partial update with comments suggesting where to make changes, but didn't include the full original code.

To properly fix this issue, you would need to:

1. Find the config object in your existing fluid-cursor.tsx file
2. Add the COLORFUL property to it (set to false by default)

Without seeing the full original file, I can't provide the complete code. You'll need to open your existing fluid-cursor.tsx file and make the change directly where the config object is defined.
